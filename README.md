# UMG_Viewmodel

Instructions:

Build "Weapon" Widget inside Unreal Engine 5 (latest version) using UMG.

TUID-Exercise-Reference.pdf has the reference Widget that you need to build in Unreal Engine.
TUID-Exercise.ai / TUID-Fonts folders have the files provided that you can use to create the Widget.
You are able to create your own assets if needed or use directly the provided assets.

This is an individual widget so no need to create other supporting screens around that.
Let's imagine that the widget is going to be used in an "Inspect Weapon" screen of a Battle Royale shooter game.

-----------------
Requirements:

That widget must meet the next requirements:
- Text with the amount of Ammo/Power/Durability
- Weapon Image
- Rarity (background color)
- Weapon Name
- Description texts with and without icon

Bonus Points:
- Weapon Background with some animation (Glow, Movement, etc) using Materials.
- The fewer the textures the better.


Keep in mind that the Widget should be reusable in other Widgets and parameterizable.
The parameters are really important to customize the widget.
Build as many Widgets as you want to create the main Weapon widget.  

------------------

Delivery:
Zip file with:
- Unreal Project
- Any other file (AI, PSD, etc) created by you for this exercise.
- Documentation in PDF explaining the different parameters of the widget.
    - For example, A document that is aiming to Artists/Designers, which parameters should I change, how it works in other Widgets, etc.
